        This will be a free website that can help with your future classes. Instead of paying for Chegg or CourseHero, you can find most of the important materials such as syllabuses, class notes, documents, teacher's notes, links to pdf books, and more for FREE. You may even upload allowed materials (excluding homework solutions) of your own from previous classes to help the future students. This website will also include the professor's info such as their email address and link to ratemyprofessor.com for each class that they taught.
